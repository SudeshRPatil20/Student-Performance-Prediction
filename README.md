Thanks for the details! Based on your project structure and the ML task (predicting student performance based on demographic and educational features), here’s a **clean, professional-level `README.md`** that communicates purpose, usage, and structure effectively.

# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict students' academic performance in math, reading, and writing based on demographic and educational features. The model is deployed using a Flask-based web application and containerized for scalable deployment.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

This project uses demographic data and test preparation history to predict academic performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights to educators and policymakers for early intervention and resource allocation.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Description

Each record in the dataset contains the following fields:

- `gender`
- `race/ethnicity`
- `parental level of education`
- `lunch`
- `test preparation course`
- `math score`
- `reading score`
- `writing score`

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Input Features** are collected from the user via a web form:

   * Gender
   * Ethnicity group
   * Parental education level
   * Lunch type
   * Test preparation status

2. The model predicts:

   * Math Score
   * Reading Score
   * Writing Score

3. Results are displayed instantly on the frontend.

## 📘 Notebooks

Explore the [`notebook/`](./notebook) directory for:

* 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* 📌 Data preprocessing
* 📌 Model experimentation

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Make sure to have the EB CLI installed and configured.

```bash
eb init -p python-3.10 student-performance-app
eb create student-performance-env
eb open
```

Deployment configurations are set in the `.ebextensions/` folder.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Improve model performance with advanced algorithms
* 🔄 Store data in a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
* 📊 Add data visualization to web UI
* 🧪 Include unit tests
* 📤 CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

Let me know if:
- You used **Streamlit** instead of **Flask** (I’ll adjust accordingly),
- You want this to support **multi-model** deployment (like regression + classification),
- You’d like me to generate a matching `Dockerfile`, `setup.py`, or `CI/CD` template.
```
